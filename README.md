This is a Desktop Environment sketch I'm working on that I felt like sharing. If I ever were to make this into something real, I would of course make sure to remove all proprietary parts and add the appropriate license(s) for the open source parts I've used.

### Inspiration
- macOS
- elementary OS (Pantheon)
- Ubuntu (GNOME)
- Kubuntu (KDE Plasma)
- Zorin OS
- Windows 10
