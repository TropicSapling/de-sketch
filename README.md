Sketch of how my ideal Desktop Environment layout would look like. Created using Figma.

Please note that this is just a sketch. If I ever were to make this into something real, I would of course make sure to remove all proprietary parts and add the appropriate license(s) for the open source parts I've used.

### Inspiration
